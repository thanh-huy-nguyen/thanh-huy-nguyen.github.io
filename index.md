## About me

I am a Research Associate at Computational Biology Department, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof.[Min Xu](https://xulabs.github.io/). I am also affiliated with Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, advised by Prof.[Ulas Bagci](https://bagcilab.com/). 

My research interests broadly lie in **AI for Healthcare**, at the intersection of machine learning **(ML)**, computer vision **(CV)**, and medical image computing **(MIC)** including:
* **(ML&CV)** Learning with Imperfect & Limited Annotation: Label Scarcity, Domain Shift, Imbalanced Subpopulation Distribution, Unsupervised and Representation learning, Uncertainty Quantification.
* Fundamental **(MIC)**: Medical Image Segmentation/Reconstruction/Registration, Foundation Models in Medical Imaging, Learning with Multi-modality data, Integration of Imaging and Clinical data.

Feel free to reach out to me! I actively discuss various topics with folks! I am open to collaboration, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you're excited about these topics and would like to work together!
